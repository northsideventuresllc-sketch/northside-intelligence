/**
 * THE FACE — the server-side reads behind the two voice panels (Build Plan B, step 3).
 *
 * Same fail-safe shape as lib/axon-v0/face-reads.ts: server-only, the service key never
 * reaches the browser, and every read resolves to `null` on any failure rather than
 * throwing. `null` is what draws the written "not answering" state instead of an empty list
 * that would read as "nothing to do".
 *
 * Both reads are READ-ONLY. Voice in step 3 shows and reads back; it never sends, posts,
 * spends or fires.
 *
 * Where today's plan comes from: **EXEC's own daily post on the agent bus.** The Executive
 * agent writes one row a night to `agent_bus` addressed to everyone, subject
 * `AXON-EXEC-AGENT-NIGHTLY-<date>`, with a JSON body carrying a written
 * `plain_english_summary` — one bullet per line, in EXEC's words. That is the plan the
 * panel shows. If there is no post for today, the EXEC session note for the same date is
 * used instead, and if there is neither the panel says "No plan posted yet today". Nothing
 * is ever written by this screen.
 *
 * Tables read, both read-only:
 *   agent_bus       — EXEC's daily post (from_agent like 'AXON Executive%')
 *   session_notes_apartment — EXEC's own session note, the fallback
 *   agent_dispatch  — the queue, for anything waiting on JB
