/**
 * THE FACE — the orb's "agents working" signal.
 *
 * Step 2 wired the real one: the home screen polls `GET /api/axon-v0/face/summary` every
 * 15 seconds (lib/axon-v0/use-face-summary.ts) and passes the live count in here. A count
 * above zero beats the orb. The mock timer below is now only a fallback — it runs when the
 * route errors or has not answered yet, so the orb never sits dead behind a failed read.
 *
 * Step 4 of Build Plan B adds a second live source alongside the summary count: the agent
 * activity feed's own working signal (a presence heartbeat within ten minutes OR a bus row
 * within the last two — lib/axon-v0/face-activity.mjs, `resolveActivityWorking`). Either
 * source saying "working" is enough; the hook shape otherwise does not change.
 *
 * The URL still wins over everything: `?working=1` pins it working, `?working=0` pins it resting.
 * Read straight off `window.location` rather than through the router hook so the page needs
 * no Suspense boundary and still renders identically on the server.
 *
 * The pin parsing and the swing timing live in lib/axon-v0/face-signal.mjs so they can be
 * tested offline (tests/face-signal.test.mjs) without React or a browser.
