/**
 * THE FACE — the Dash home screen (Build Plan B, steps 1 and 2).
 *
 * Spec: docs/the-face/SPEC.md. `app/(axon-v0)/page.tsx` renders this at `/`; the old home
 * deck sits at `/deck` behind one quiet micro-label until it retires.
 *
 * Step 1 was the orb alone. Step 2 puts the dashboard around it without moving it: the orb
 * stays centre and dominant, two glass stat cards sit to its left, two to its right, and
 * the revenue card and the module list run underneath. On a narrow screen the orb is still
 * first and everything else flows below it.
 *
 * All five numbers and the orb's pulse come from one poll of `GET /api/axon-v0/face/summary`
 * every 15 seconds. Nothing on this screen is ever a made-up number: a source that did not
 * answer shows its written empty state.
 *
 * Step 3 adds the voice panel under the orb: hold to talk, a level meter driven by the real
 * microphone, a thinking timer, a live transcript, and a spoken one-line reply. Three
 * read-only commands — today's plan, what needs you, show agents — each of which replaces
 * exactly one panel. Nothing is sent to a model and nothing acts on the world.
 *
 * Step 4 adds the agent activity trail: the last 30 minutes of `agent_bus` traffic, newest
 * first, right of the module list on a wide screen and below everything on a narrow one.
 * Its own working signal (a presence heartbeat within ten minutes OR a bus row within the
 * last two) ORs into the orb's pulse alongside the summary route's count, and a new row
 * since the last poll triggers one visible burst on the orb.
 *
 * `?working=1` pins the orb working, `?working=0` pins it resting.
